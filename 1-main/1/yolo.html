                Motivation: I am very interested in machine learning. This case is a great opportunity for me to learn more about deep learning.
            </div>

            <div class="application text">
                Application: In a short period of time, the emergency medical team must make an effective diagnosis and emergency treatment, we hope to use artificial intelligence to stabilize the patient's condition at the first moment.

            <div class="expectation text">
                Problem : This system must add a pain warning to make sense. If pain is detected, the system will make a sound, but to be honest I am not very good at this,so I leave it to my partner to do it.

                <p class="subsubtitle text">From YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, and YOLOv7, select the most accurate method among various models. After downloading the official YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, and YOLOv7 built-in models for testing, we found that the test result of YOLOv7 (general
                    objects such as cats and dogs) is better. However, after we trained with custom training weights (chest pain expression), the detection results of YOLOv7 were poor, but the training results of YOLOv4 and YOLOv6 were the best, so we
                    finally chose YOLOv4 and YOLOv6 as the basis for training.As shown on the right.

                    Set up the system in the actual medical field. When the patient goes to the hospital for medical treatment, let the doctor diagnose other patients, or when there are affairs that need to be dealt with immediately, the identification system we built can
                    be used for judgment to reduce the delay time and reduce damage.
